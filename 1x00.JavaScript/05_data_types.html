    <h2>Data Types</h2>
    <p> When we create a variable, the data that we define has a type. </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Primitive Types</b> - Stored directly in the location that the variables is accessed</li>
        <li><b>Reference Types (Objects)</b> - Accessed by reference</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The 7 primitive data types are the following</p>
    <ul>
        String - a sequence of characters. In JavaScript, strings can be enclosed within the single or double quotes
        Number - Represent both integer and floating-point numbers
        Boolean - Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false
        Null - Represents the intentional absence of any object value
        Undefined - A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.
        Symbol - It is a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol-that is unique
        BigInt - New data type used for numbers that are greater than the Number type can handle.
    </ul>

    <p>The 3 reference types are</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b><u>Arrays</u></b> : they're essentially a data structure that can hold multiple values.</li>
        <li><b><u>Objects</u></b> : are comma separated lists of name-value pairs</li>
        <li><b><u>Functions</u></b> : they can have properties and methods. What distinguishes them from other objects is that they can be called.</li>
    </ul>
